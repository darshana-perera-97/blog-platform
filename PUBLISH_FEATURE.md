# Blog Publishing Feature

This document explains the new publishing feature that allows users to control which of their blog posts are visible on the sample blog page.

## 🎯 Overview

The blog platform now includes a **publish/unpublish** feature that gives users complete control over which of their posts are publicly visible. All posts are created as **private by default** and must be explicitly published to appear on the sample blog page.

## 🔒 Security-First Approach

### Default Privacy
- ✅ **All new posts are private by default**
- ✅ **AI-generated posts are private by default**
- ✅ **Users must explicitly publish posts**
- ✅ **No accidental public exposure**

### User Control
- ✅ **Users can publish/unpublish at any time**
- ✅ **Publication status is clearly indicated**
- ✅ **Easy toggle buttons in the dashboard**
- ✅ **Immediate status updates**

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Creating Posts
When users create new posts (manually or via AI generation):
- Posts are automatically set to **private**
- No public checkbox during creation
- Clear messaging about privacy status

### 2. Publishing Posts
Users can publish their posts from the blog dashboard:
- **Publish Button**: Makes post visible on sample blog page
- **Unpublish Button**: Removes post from public view
- **Status Badges**: Clear visual indicators (Public/Private)
- **Loading States**: Feedback during status changes

### 3. Sample Blog Page
The sample blog page only shows:
- ✅ **Published posts** from the configured user
- ❌ **Private posts** are never visible
- ✅ **Real-time updates** when posts are published/unpublished

## 📋 API Endpoints

### New Publish Endpoint
```http
PATCH /api/posts/:id/publish
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "isPublic": true  // or false
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My Blog Post",
  "isPublic": true,
  "message": "Post published successfully"
}
```

### Updated Create Post Endpoint
```http
POST /api/posts
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "title": "My Post",
  "content": "Post content...",
  "metaDescription": "Optional description"
}
```

**Note**: `isPublic` field is ignored - all posts default to private.

### Updated Edit Post Endpoint
```http
PUT /api/posts/:id
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "title": "Updated Title",
  "content": "Updated content...",
  "metaDescription": "Updated description"
}
```

**Note**: `isPublic` field is ignored - publication status is managed separately.

## 🎨 User Interface
